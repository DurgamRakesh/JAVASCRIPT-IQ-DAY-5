    <p>27.What is hoisting?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, Hoisting is a javascript mechanism where functions and variables are moved to top of the their scope before code execution.
        -Javascript allows only variable declarations , not initialization.
        -variable hoisting: In terms of variable hoisting , like var is hoisting but let and const keywords are not hoisted because they are in temporal dead zone.
        -we can access a function or a variable before its declarations this is called hoisting behavior.
    </pre>

    <p>28.What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, A Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior that occur when declating a variable with let and const keywords , but not happens with var keyword.
        -The time span when that happens, between the creating a variable and binding its declaration is called Temporal Dead Zone.
    </pre>

    <p>29.What is the DOM?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, DOM stands for Document Object Model it is a programming interfacefor web documents.
        it represents the page so the program can easily change the style, content, structure.the DOM represents the documents as nodes and objects.
        simply it is a way of programming language to interact with the page.

        DOM Methods:
        getElementById()
        getElementsByClassName()
        getElementsByTagName()
        querySelector()
        querySelectorAll()

        DOM some propertys:
        innerHTML
        textcontent
        innertext
        and etc...
    </pre>

    <p>30.Explain passed by value and passed by reference?</p>
    <pre>
        passed by value:-
        function is called directly by passing a value of a variable as an argument.
        so any changes made outside of the function does not effect the original value.
        -In pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy.
        so any changes , made inside function made to copy value not original value.

        EX:
        function sqr(a){
           return a*a
        }
        let b = 10;
        console.log(sqr(b)); --->100
        console.log(b); --->10 value not change

        passed by reference:-
        function is called directly by passing reference/address of a variable as an argument.
        so any changes made outside of the function is effect the original value.
        -In pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy.
        so any changes , made inside function is effect to the original value.
        
        EX:
        let student = {
            name:'abc',
            id: 1001
        }
        function incid(obj){
            obj.id+=1
        }
        incid(student);
        consol.log(student);
    </pre>

    <p>31.Write code to explain map and filter in arrays?</p>
    <pre>
        map:
        const arr = [ 1,2,3,4,5];

        const newarr = arr.map((element) => element*2);
        console.log(newarr);

        filter:
        const arr1 = [ 1,2,3,4,5];

        const newarr1 = arr.filter((element) => element > 2);
        console.log(newarr1);
    </pre>

    <p>32.What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, async function is a function declared with the async keyword.
        and await is keyword is used inside async function.
        -The async/await keywords are enables asychronous ,promise-based behavior to written in a cleaner style.avoiding need of promise chain.
        -The use of await keyword pause the function until the promise return the result value.

        EX:
        let p  = new Promise((res,rej) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                res('this is promis function')
            }, 5000);
        })
        
        async function asyncfunction(){
            let result = await p
            console.log(result);
            console.log('this is async function');
        }
        asyncfunction();
    </pre>

    <p>33.Give an example of async/await?</p>
    <pre>
        EX:
        let p  = new Promise((res,rej) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                res('this is promis function')
            }, 5000);
        })
        
        async function asyncfunction(){
            let result = await p
            console.log(result);
            console.log('this is async function');
        }
        asyncfunction();
